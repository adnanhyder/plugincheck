# monetize-more

Write a plugin which does the following tasks.

    Register a custom post type name property

    Register metabox to save some information regarding property such as number of bedrooms, bathroom, area and store them in a custom database table instead of postmeta.

        Also give reason why are we storing data in custom table instead of postmen

    On creation of new post we need to send email to members

        For this, register a CRON job which runs every midnight and send an email containing a new listing.

    Also use rewriting api and add a new endpoint at the end of each post permalink named gallery

        At the endpoint render a custom template which shows the property gallery.

The deliverable is a private github repo so we can review and ask questions in the pull request. Please add stephan.depta@googlemail.com and shakeeb@monetizemore.com to that repo.
